i.Interest of content

Sound

I might be a bit biased because I have to read pages of text in the morning but I just did not find the content very interesting.
The authors don't go into much depth, but some parts are still relevant.

ii.Consistency and quality of visual presentation

50%
Good

The website is consistent throughout and does the job, however, there is so little CSS everything looks barren and super static.
Images in particular really need styling otherwise they look out of place especially when you resize the page

iii.Quality of written presentation

50%
Good

The paragraphs are worded in a way that can be confusing, depending on the authors but most of the website is pretty well written.
The lack of depth can make for vague and/or bland commentary.
Also, there is a typo in the home page, so, yikes.

iv.Validity of HTML

40%
Sound

HTML is fine but the authors make no use of CSS and almost no use of bootstrap. On all pages but one, the indentation is inconsistent and makes
the HTML almost unreadable. The website looks fine but behind the scenes, it is a bit of a mess. There are artifacts on the AI page.
