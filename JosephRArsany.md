i.  Interest of content<br>
    The content on all pages are deep and engaging.
    Their is clear evidence that the pages were written fully by the
    authors and their is no evidence of plagarism. The pages clearly
    highlight the authors genuine interest in the subjects. The only
    complaint is that the AI page is disproportionately small compared
    to the other pages. For the above reasons I rate this section
    |Exemplary|.<br>
ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation<br>
    All the pages have a
    non-default background that distinguishes them from the average page
    on the net. The text of all pages is in the non-default colour of
    green. One gripe that arises is the default nature of the text font.
    Upon examination, the font has not been specified with in the source
    code of this project. For the aformentioned reasons I rate this
    section as |Outstanding|<br>
iii. Quality of written presentation<br>
    Upon examination, I have found no
    glaring spelling or grammar mistakes. The text is well spaced as not
    to cluster and form a wall of text. Care was clearly taken to divide
    text into relevent headings to increase readability. As such I rate
    this section |Exemplary|<br>
iv. Validity of HTML<br>
    Upon inspection of the console, one will find no
    errors or warnings suggesting that the written html was not ambiguos
    as the webpage has had to make no guesses as to the intentions of
    the author. The html code is well structured with relevent dividers
    and ids. The only potential complaint would be the lack of author
    comments in the source code. This may make it difficult to read or
    edit the code in the future. Upon consideration to the above, I rate
    this section |Outstanding|<br>
v.  Evidence of collaboration<br>
    By viewing the commits it is clear to see
    that their is an even contribution by collaborators. The timestamps
    on the commits suggest that progress was made evenly across the
    week. We can also see that author information was added by different
    users. Given the above assessment I rate this section as |Perfect|.
    All points were succesfully attained and were completed at a high
    standard.
