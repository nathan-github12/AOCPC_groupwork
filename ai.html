	<h1>AI and the good it does</h1>
	<p>Reasons computers help our learning:</p>
	<ul>
    		<li>Being able to <a href="http:www.google.com">Google</a> a question and finding out the answer right away.</li>
    		<li>You can get a book as a pdf and search for a specific word faster than you would be able to in a book.</li>
    		<li>There's online videos so you can be taught rather than teaching yourself.</li>

	<h2>DeepMind AI</h2>
	<p>
		DeepMind is a division of Alphabet which is owned by Google, they're responsible 
		for developing general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI). They have trained a 
		neural network, a type of AI algorithm, to guess missing words or characters from Greek
		inscriptions. Their algorithm was put to the test against humans, the humans took over 
		2 hours and were 30% less accurate, the AI took seconds.
